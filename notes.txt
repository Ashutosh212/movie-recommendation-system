Things Done(24-07-25):
1. All preprocessing Done for Semantic Part
2. Created embedding for first 100 movies
3. System work properly 

Things Done(25-07-25):
1. Gui done with streamlit
2. Connected gui web to fastapi predict url
3. Integration work properly 

Next:
1. Define function in /post for query using input and return most similar movies

Problems:
1. Storing Vector in numpy array.
2. Using Cosine similarty that is not scalable
3. Use some advance searching techinques for decreasing latency
4. Read about re-ranker and how it is different from cosine similarty


Features to add:
1. Use stemming and other preprocessing techinques to add hybrid searching Feature
2. Ask user two thing Movie name or type of movie or both, use system prompt to search appropriate movie
2. Use FastAPI and streamlit to get a hands-on production side
3. Deploy this on EC2


Priorities:
1. FastAPI and streamlit integration (Done)
2. Push to Docker Hub
3. Add fast search system like ANN
4. Deploy on EC2


What was happening when you ran "streamlit run frontend/app.py"
- You were getting an error of No module found 'backend' beacuse

Streamlit sets the working directory to frontend/, and Python treats frontend/ as the root. 
So it looks for backend/ inside frontend/, which doesn’t exist.

- So it get solved when i added "sys.path.append(".")" this line to script

Another option is run ""streamlit run ./frontend/app.py""

Docker thing


▶️ To run Streamlit:


docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  recommender-app
  
Streamlit runs on port 8501.

▶️ To run FastAPI (with Uvicorn):

docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  recommender-app \
  uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

This overrides the default CMD and runs Uvicorn directly.
