Things Done(24-07-25):
1. All preprocessing Done for Semantic Part
2. Created embedding for first 100 movies
3. System work properly 

Problems:
1. Storing Vector in numpy array.
2. Using Cosine similarty that is not scalable
3. Use some advance searching techinques for decreasing latency
4. Read about re-ranker and how it is different from cosine similarty


Features to add:
1. Use stemming and other preprocessing techinques to add hybrid searching Feature
2. Ask user two thing Movie name or type of movie or both, use system prompt to search appropriate movie
2. Use FastAPI and streamlit to get a hands-on production side
3. Deploy this on EC2


Priorities:
1. FastAPI and streamlit integration
2. Deploy on EC2
3. Add fast search system like ANN
